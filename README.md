In this repository implementations of the following Reinforcement Algorithms can be found. 

* Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Dynamic Programming
* Monte Carlo, Temporal-Difference Learning
* Function Approximation, Deep RL
* Multi-agent RL

The agents are trained under the game [RoboCup 2D Half Field Offense](https://github.com/LARG/HFO)
